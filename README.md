# Password Generator

This is my coding challenge submission for day #5 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is a simple application that uses a list of letters, numbers and symbols to genrate a random password. The application takes 3 inputs from the user; the number of letters, numbers and symbols the user wishes to use for the generated password.

## Usage

```
How many letters would you like in your password?

How many symbols would you like?

How many numbers would you like?

Your password is: xa634r8z2*$!(&r
```
