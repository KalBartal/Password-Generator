## Password Generator Project

This is my coding challenge submission for day #5 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.


This is a project to generate passwords using Python. It allows users to customize their passwords with a combination of letters, symbols and numbers.

### Requirements
- Python 3

### Usage
Run the project via a Python terminal and follow the prompts.

### Code Structure
The code starts by defining three string lists, one for characters, one for numbers and one for symbols. It then asks for the user to input the amount of letters, symbols and numbers they want in their password. It takes the input from the user and then generates a password from a random combination of the letters, symbols and numbers.
